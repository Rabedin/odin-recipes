    <ul>
      <li>200g Chicken (raw weight)</li>

    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>Prep 1/2 cup of uncooked rice in your rice cooker</li>
      <li>Chop your chicken to your preference, I liked to do roughly 1 inch cubes</li>
      <li>Throw it into your large frying pan with all the seasonings</li>
      <li>Pour olive oil over it all, don't go overboard</li>
      <li>Mix the seasonings and chicken well so that all pieces are evenly covered</li>
      <li>Set the burner to medium-high heat and cook it until 165 degrees farenheight at the center, or until it looks cooked enough</li>
      <li>Once both the chicken and rice are cooked, put them together in a bowl and enjoy</li>
    </ol>
